**3 Types of design patterns:**
1.Creational patterns
2.Structural patterns

**Creational Design patterns:**
i.Deal with process of **_object creation_** and trying to make more flexible and efficient.
ii.Makes the system independent

_**1.1 Factory Method:**_
Provides an interface for **creating objects in superclass** but subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class

**_1.2 Abstract Factory Method_**
Provides an interface for **creating families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes

**_1.3 Builder Method_**
Provides an interface for **constructing an object and then have concrete builder classes** that implement this interface to create specific objects in a stepwise manner

**_1.4 Prototype Method_**
Provides to **create new objects with the same structure and initial state as an existing object** without explicitly specifying their classes or construction details

**_1.5 Singleton Method_**
Provides **class has only one instance and that instance provides a global point of access to it**
